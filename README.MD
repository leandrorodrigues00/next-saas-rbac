## üë©‚Äçüíª About the project

This project is a full-stack SaaS platform designed for project management, emphasizing **role-based access control (RBAC)** powered by **CASL**. It allows users to create and manage projects efficiently while providing fine-grained control over permissions and access levels, ensuring secure collaboration across teams.

The platform features a **Next.js 14** front-end, powered by **React 19**, utilizing Server Components and Server Actions for improved performance and scalability. On the back-end, it leverages Node.js, Fastify, and Prisma for high-performance data handling and seamless API communication. By adopting a monorepo architecture with TurboRepo, it streamlines the development process, allowing for faster builds and shared resources between the front-end and back-end.

Key features include:

- **Multi-tenant architecture** for managing multiple organizations and workspaces.
- **Integrated authentication** for secure user login and management.
- **RBAC authorization** for fine-tuned control over user permissions, allowing administrators to assign specific roles with granular access rights.
- **Project and task management** tools, designed for efficiency and collaboration.
- **Member invitations and management**, ensuring easy team onboarding.
- **Detailed billing system**, providing clear usage tracking and billing for organizations.

This project serves as a **boilerplate** for building SaaS applications, with a strong foundation in authentication, authorization, and multi-tenancy. It‚Äôs optimized for developers looking to create robust SaaS platforms with modern tooling, security, and scalability built-in.

**Important Notice**: This project is deployed with the backend hosted on Render and the frontend on Vercel. Since the backend is running on Render's free tier, the server may take up to 60 seconds to start after the first request. Render has a usage limit for free-tier projects, but running the project locally should not cause any issues.

**Clone the project and access the folder**

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/leandrorodrigues00/next-saas-rbac && cd next-saas-rbac

```

**Follow the steps below**

To run the application, you will need to start the server in the `/apps/api` folder and the web application in the `/apps/web` folder.

```bash
# Install the dependencies in the root folder `/`
$ pnpm i

# Make a copy of '.env.example' to '.env'
# and set with YOUR environment variables.
$ cp .env.example .env

# Use Docker to start the database. If needed, adjust the settings in the `/docker-compose.yml` file:
$  docker compose up 

# Navigate to the apps/api directory and run Prisma commands to set up the database schema and seed the database:
$ cd apps/api 
$ pnpm dlx prisma generate
$ pnpm run db:migrate
$ pnpm run db:seed

# Return to the root of the project and start the development server. TurboRepo will handle the build and start all necessary processes:
$ cd ../..  # Return to the root directory
$ pnpm run dev
```
